# Acknowledgements


Thank you to Nate Murray, my publisher, for his advice and endless patience, Gillian Merchant for her excellent review of later revisions, my partner for discussions about form and content, all my encouraging friends, family, colleagues at [Catalyst](https://www.catalyst.net.nz/) and [Toitū Te Whenua](https://www.linz.govt.nz/), and Andrew Maguire and John Billings for reviewing an early draft of the book. Special thanks to all the Bash community contributors on Stack Overflow, Unix & Linux Stack Exchange and Greg’s Wiki, which are treasure troves of information about all things Bash.
