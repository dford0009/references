# About this book


*Fullstack Bash Scripting* is an exploration of the Bash shell, scripting language and related tools. It’s aimed at developers who want to get the job done right the first time, and make sure maintenance is a breeze. Topics include:

- how to find help on arbitrary commands
- how to structure a robust and maintainable script
- editing commands and interacting with the terminal efficiently
- tools for dealing with version control, JSON, XML, text encodings, images and compressed files
- quality assurance
- … and much more

The goal of this book is to give you the tools and techniques to write Bash scripts which will stand the test of time, and to give you the means to explore the vast shell scripting ecosystem to find the tools you need right now.

### Audience

Bash is *the* Linux glue language, so this book is aimed at software developers mainly working in some other language. We assume that you have working knowledge of programming concepts like variable assignments, loops and files, and at least a passing familiarity with [interactive shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&oldid=1011422085).
