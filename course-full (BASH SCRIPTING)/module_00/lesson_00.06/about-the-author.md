# About the author


My name is Victor Engmark. I have been a software developer since 2004, free and open source software contributor since 2007, Stack Overflow & Stack Exchange contributor since 2009, and a Bash user since 2010.

My first big task using Bash was to change a [write–once read–many](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Write_once_read_many&oldid=1008717014) script to be properly robust. I ended up pulling it apart into maybe a dozen scripts and unit testing each of them separately. It was a great learning experience: for the rest of my time in that job there were no bug reports for it, which cemented the value of testing and the fact that Bash scripts *can* be made robust.
