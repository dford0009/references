# Organization of this book


The themes of this book are closely related, and it is probably better suited for exploration than for reading from cover to cover. That said, it is roughly divided into the following sections:

**Basics,** which includes getting help for arbitrary commands, running scripts, editing commands, and how to copy and paste effectively.

**Common tasks,** including listing files, working with text, math, time, script output, JSON, XML, images, compression and SSH.

**Managing scripts,** which first goes through common ingredients of a productionâ€“grade script, then follows up with version control, exit codes and quality assurance.

Two **advanced subjects,** signals and autocompletion.

I have intentionally excluded other scripting languages, such as AWK, Perl, Ruby and sed. There are already many books about them, and to do them justice would easily make this book several times longer.
