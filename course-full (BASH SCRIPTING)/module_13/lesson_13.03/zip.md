# Zip


This compressed format has been supported by the builtâ€“in file manager in Windows for decades, so it is still commonly found on that platform.

To create a zip file: `zip --recurse-paths backup.zip ./project`

To list the files in a zip file: `unzip -l backup.zip`

And to extract a zip file: `unzip backup.zip`
