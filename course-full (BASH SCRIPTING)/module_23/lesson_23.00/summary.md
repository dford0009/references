In this book Iâ€™ve tried to present Bash itself, popular tools and techniques, pitfalls and workarounds. I hope it has given you enough knowledge to build commands and scripts while confident that the result will be not just useful but robust and maintainable.

Bash is everywhere. Since 1989 it has grown to be the most popular shell on \*nixes, and it will be around for longer still. It is simple to get started with, hard to master, and you can do incredible things with a line or two. Happy scripting, thank you for reading, and good luck!
