# Version Control

Prerequisites: Before reading this chapter, you should have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and should be familiar with [editing commands](#editing).

After this chapter you will have learned your first shell superpower! If that sounds like a tall order, consider this: after learning a handful of very simple commands you will be able to *back up your most important files in private and for free and sync these files to all your machines with a single tool available on every modern operating system.*

Currently the field of version control systems is completely dominated by [Git](https://git-scm.com/), so that’s what we’ll use. One advantage of learning Git in a shell is that the vast majority of what you learn is transferable to other version control systems, and will likely be transferable to future version control systems.
