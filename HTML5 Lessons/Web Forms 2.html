<!--

Web Forms 2.0 is an extension to the forms features found in HTML4. 
Form elements and attributes in HTML5 provide a greater degree of semantic mark-up than HTML4 
and free us from a great deal of tedious scripting and styling that was required in HTML4.

HTML 4 Inputs
1	
text
A free-form text field, nominally free of line breaks.

2	
password
A free-form text field for sensitive information, nominally free of line breaks.

3	
checkbox
A set of zero or more values from a predefined list.

4	
radio
An enumerated value.

5	
submit
A free form of button initiates form submission.

6	
file
An arbitrary file with a MIME type and optionally a file name.

7	
image
A coordinate, relative to a particular image's size, with the extra semantic that it must be the last value selected and initiates form submission.

8	
hidden
An arbitrary string that is not normally displayed to the user.

9	
select
An enumerated value, much like the radio type.

10	
textarea
A free-form text field, nominally with no line break restrictions.

11	
button
A free form of button which can initiates any event related to button.

HTML 4 EXAMPLE
<form action = "http://example.com/cgiscript.pl" method = "post">  
   <p> 
      <label for = "firstname">first name: </label> 
      <input type = "text" id = "firstname"><br /> 
   
      <label for = "lastname">last name: </label> 
      <input type = "text" id = "lastname"><br /> 
   
      <label for = "email">email: </label> 
      <input type = "text" id = "email"><br> 
   
      <input type = "radio" name = "sex" value = "male"> Male<br> 
      <input type = "radio" name = "sex" value = "female"> Female<br> 
      <input type = "submit" value = "send"> <input type = "reset"> 
   </p> 
</form> 

HTML 5 INPUT ADDITIONS

1	datetime
A date and time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fractions of a second) encoded according to ISO 8601 with the time zone set to UTC.

2	datetime-local
A date and time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fractions of a second) encoded according to ISO 8601, with no time zone information.

3	date
A date (year, month, day) encoded according to ISO 8601.

4	month
A date consisting of a year and a month encoded according to ISO 8601.

5	week
A date consisting of a year and a week number encoded according to ISO 8601.

6	time
A time (hour, minute, seconds, fractional seconds) encoded according to ISO 8601.

7	number
It accepts only numerical value. The step attribute specifies the precision, defaulting to 1.

8	range
The range type is used for input fields that should contain a value from a range of numbers.

9	email
It accepts only email value. This type is used for input fields that should contain an e-mail address. If you try to submit a simple text, it forces to enter only email address in email@example.com format.

10	url
It accepts only URL value. This type is used for input fields that should contain a URL address. If you try to submit a simple text, it forces to enter only URL address either in http://www.example.com format or in http://example.com format.

OUTPUT ELEMENT

HTML5 introduced a new element <output> which is used to represent the result of different types of output, such as output written by a script.

You can use the for attribute to specify a relationship between the output element and other elements in the document that affected the calculation (for example, as inputs or parameters). The value of the for attribute is a space-separated list of IDs of other elements.
