<!-- HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ADDING AN IMAGE

  Note that img elements are self-closing.

All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.
