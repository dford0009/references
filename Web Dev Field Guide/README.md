## Code referenced in the book

Throughout the book you'll see sentences like the following: 

>>> Once you have downloaded and unzipped the code folder, click File -> Open, and select the [`1-setup/test-file.txt`](code/src/1-setup/test-file.txt).  

What this sentence is saying is navigate inside the code folder that you downloaded, find the folder called "1-setup" and open the "test-file.txt" file.  All the other Exercises requiring you use something from the code folder follow this structure.

I would recommend downloading the complete code folder onto your Desktop and when one of the Exercises ask you to use a file, open the file from that folder.  As opposed to individually downloading the folders as you go.
