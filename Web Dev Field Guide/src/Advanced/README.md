# How to Use the Advanced Material

Below are the instructions on how to access and use the Advanced Material.  If you have any questions, email us at **us@fullstack.io**.

## Study Guide

**[Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-PCKU1BC_kNtbYQTWt0rjhUdD8FSftct1RAHjm59ZQ/edit?usp=sharing)** to the Study Guide.

**[Here is a link](https://fullstack.wistia.com/medias/2cmvmjj9li) to a video** with all the instructions you will need to get started on the Study Guide.  I highly recommend watching the video first.  Then, if you have any questions, refer to the following documentation.

_I say, in the video üé¨, that "this link will be emailed to you."  I was incorrect. The link above is the link to use._

* Step 1.  **Make A Copy**.  You only have View Access.  You need to make your own copy. Click File -> "Make a Copy".  If the "Make a Copy" option is greyed out, that means you need to sign into to a google account. If you don't have one, you will need to make one.

* Step 2. On the Dashboard, add your Start and Finish date on Column J, row 6 and 7.  You don't have to enter these; the dashboard will work without them.  

* Step 3. You can navigate to the various tabs by clicking on them, or you can click on the hyperlinks found on Column I, row 18 through 27.  

* Step 4. Navigate to a tab and review some of the tasks.  You can complete these in any order you like, but I recommend you complete the sheets 1 - 9, and the tasks from top to bottom.  They build off of each other.  When you complete a task, click on the checkbox, enter the date you completed the task, and how many hours it took you.

From here, the Dashboard and metrics will run automatically. 

#### Easter Eggs ü•ö:

There are some extras, I've included, like emailing the Dashboard to you.  Refer to the second half of the video for instructions.

## Interviews üéô

We have uploaded all the interviews on Wista.  Watch them in whatever order you would like, except for the first one.  The first video you should watch is the one with Carlos Perez.  I am queuing his video up first because the introduction to his video includes more information about all the other videos, including, why I sound like I have a lisp at times üòâ.

Below are the bios and links for each interview.

**Job Title**: Founder of Bike Monkey, Inc. 
Company: https://www.bikemonkey.net
LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/in/clayperez/

**You Don‚Äôt Have to Work in Tech to be Programmer**

Carlos is a celebrated community member in Sonoma County, California.  Through his company Bike Monkey, he has raised over $2 million for at-Risk Youth and $1.1 million for those affected by wildfires in Sonoma County.  Carlos‚Äô story of being a computer-inclined 5 year old to a Founder/CEO exemplifies the power of self-learning and passion.  Carlos had a non-traditional education.  He was homeschooled, and by the age of 19-20 was skilled enough to land his first programming job.  He worked in the corporate-tech world for 10 years but left in hopes of pursuing more passionate and personal ambitions.  Today he uses his tech background and passion for making real impacts in his community.  He is a business owner, founder, leader, and motivating force in Sonoma county.  In this interview, you can hear his üíôfor programming and what it has allowed him to do.

**Job Title**: Software Engineer at Box

**Breaking Back into Tech**

I think the thing I like most about Sophia‚Äôs career path is how dynamic it is and how she used the ebbs and flows to her advantage.  Having started as a PHP developer, Sohpia, via various roles at small companies and as a consultant, learned new languages and frameworks that helped her advanced as a developer.   Adding to her story is that she did all of this while managing the demands of being a mother of two.  She has worked full-time at companies, and part-time.  She‚Äôs worked as an employee for tech companies and also managed being a self-employed consultant. Most recently, she‚Äôs back full-time at a larger tech company.  She‚Äôs a great example of how to make your situation work for you and continue to be marketable in a rapidly changing field.  Sophia is also, to date, my favorite tech writer üôÇ; her newsletters are how I got hooked on newline.io.

#### Fermin Carranza

**Job Title**: Software Developer at Formstack

**Making it Happen**

Fermin‚Äôs story is the kind you hear and can‚Äôt help but smile about.  He had an interest in programming.  Then invited his programming friends over for dinner to absorb their advice.  He then signed up for a bootcamp, and promised both himself and the instructor that he would work super hard and end up with a job at the end of it.  And he did üçæ!  I honestly wish I had the foresight to be this diligent in my own career path.  Fermin‚Äôs story helps you to believe that, yes it is possible.  His advice is both motivating and encouraging. 

#### Jeff Malnick

**The Power of Curiosity**

Jeff‚Äôs progress as a programmer is impressive.  His career path proves that curiosity, paired with a strong work ethic, can speed up your career path.  My favorite story from Jeff is how a late-night Twitter post about a Ruby script got him recruited from the CEO of his next job.  Jeff did not study Computer Science at school.  Instead, he let his interests and passion guide his personal studies, allowing him to quickly learn about complicated programming topics focusing primarily on DevOps and Systems Admin.  Jeff‚Äôs story is motivating, as he shows us what‚Äôs possible through self-teaching and hard work.
