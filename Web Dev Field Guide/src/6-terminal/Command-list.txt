/*** NAVIGATION COMMANDS ***/

The Tilde ~ indicates the HOME directory.  The HOME directory meaning the home of the user who's executing a command.  
For me this translates to `users/angel` for you it will be something like `users/yourComputersUserName`

cd - change directories.  Follow this command by the relative or absolute file path of where you'd like to navigate to.
      Example: cd ~/Desktop 
      Example: cd ../.. 
      Example: cd ./Downloads

TIP: use tab with the cd command to auto-complete your file paths.

ls - list.  This command will list the files / folders for the location you are in.
      Example: ls 

open - opens in the Finder where you are in the terminal.  Use the command followed by what you'd like to open.  
      Example: open Command-list
      Example - to open where you are in the terminal: open .

--Windows Users open command --

pwd - present working directory.  This command returns your current file path. 
      Example: pwd

man - manual.  This command brings up the manual for the command you follow it with.  Exit the manual by pressing "q".
      Example: man say

      Example: cp cashew.png ../../Desktop

find - to find things on your computer's file system.  You can define where you'd like to look as well as by what file type and or name.

      Example: find ~/Desktop -name "*/.html"

--Windows Users find command--

or if you'd like download a command that runs very similar to the `find` command.
